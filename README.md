# The keyboard switcher for Hyprland users

If you use more than two languages, you know, that is not very comfort way. Especially if you use mostly two languages, thirt at times.

It script will help you, because it based on concept, which uses on MacOS: it switches only two last languages if key combination presses only one time, but when combination presses more than one, then switches between all languages.

## Variance

Currently available onle python script. Maybe not the best as possible. But I want to implement the same logic on other languages:

[ ] Bash
[ ] Rust
[ ] C
[ ] C++

I have good knowledge only about Python and Rust languages, so implementing the logic on the other language may take more time. But, I'll glad, if you contribute it!

## Contribution

If you have some issues, or have better implementation, that I have, I'm open to contribution! Open issue or make PR, if you sure about problem.
